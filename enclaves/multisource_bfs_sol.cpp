// Multisource BFS (Breadth-First Search) is an extension of the traditional Breadth-First Search algorithm used to find the
// shortest path or minimum distance from multiple starting nodes (or sources) to other nodes in a graph, grid, or network.
// Instead of initializing the BFS from a single source node, multisource BFS initializes the search from multiple nodes simultaneously.
// Applications
// Shortest distance in grids: Find the minimum steps from multiple starting points to other points in a grid (e.g., the nearest water source for each land cell).
// Flood fill with multiple sources: Used in scenarios where you want to fill regions from multiple starting points simultaneously.
// Social networks: Finding distances in a network graph, like the minimum "friendship path" from multiple influencers to other users.
